This Java program connects to a PostgreSQL database, queries a table named "users," and prints the values of the "first_name" and "last_name" columns for each row to the console. It uses the JDBC API to establish a connection, create a statement, execute a SELECT query, and process the results in a loop. The program handles potential exceptions, such as database connection errors, by catching and printing stack traces. Finally, it ensures proper resource cleanup by closing the ResultSet, Statement, and Connection objects to prevent memory leaks. The database connection details, including URL, username, and password, are specified at the beginning of the code.
